To find this flag, we first need to look at what we have so far.

First of all, in the first line, it almost looks like a flag could be there, but the letters are jumbled up - this means that this is probably a transposition cipher.

The second character is a comma, and there are no capitalized letters, other than the ones that we think probably belong to the flag. So, the first word is almost certainly internet slang. 

One could almost assume that, with the first letters and the comma, the first bit of the first line is 'btw,'
That would mean that the first letter is the 3rd, the second is the first, the third is the fourth and the last is the second.

What if we apply this to the remainder of the text? 

Well, [after creating a script](the_well_of_chaos.py), one would find that this works.
